# UniFramework

UniFramework is a personal framework for the games I make (mainly mobile games). It contains lots of cool stuff I made and scripts/plugins from other people aswell.

## How To Use
Download the latest .unitypackage file [from the Packages folder](https://github.com/sampaiodias/UniFramework/tree/master/Packages) and open it on your project. After committing the changes, the next person to pull these changes should import the .unitypackage and commit again (because of DLLs being deleted after the first pull on another machine).

## Requirements
* Scripting Runtime .NET 4.x or higher
* Unity 2017.3 or higher (older versions might work but were not fully tested)

Using UniFramework with [Odin](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041) (bonus features for GameEvent, additional Setters and better inspectors) and UniTween is recommended (but not required).
